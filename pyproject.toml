# Bazaar-AI Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Bazaar-AI in 5 minutes! 🐪

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (when published)
```bash
pip install bazaar-ai
```

### Option 2: Install from Source (Development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chandra-gummaluru/bazaar_ai
cd bazaar_ai
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag installs in "editable" mode - changes to the code take effect immediately.

## Running the Simulator

### Command Line
```bash
bazaar-simulate
```

This will:
1. Start a WebSocket server on `ws://localhost:8765`
2. Open the simulator UI in your browser
3. Load any agents you've created in the `agents/` folder

### Programmatically
```python
from bazaar_ai.simulator import run_simulator
run_simulator()
```

## Your First Agent

### 1. Create a new file in `agents/my_first_agent.py`

```python
from bazaar_ai.trader import Trader, TraderAction
from bazaar_ai.market import MarketObservation
from typing import Callable

class MyFirstAgent(Trader):
    def __init__(self, seed, name):
        super().__init__(seed, name)
        
    def select_action(self,
                      actions: list[TraderAction],
                      observation: MarketObservation,
                      simulate_action_fnc: Callable[[TraderAction], MarketObservation]) -> TraderAction:
        # Pick the first action (not very smart, but it works!)
        return actions[0]
    
    def calculate_reward(self,
                        old_observation: MarketObservation,
                        new_observation: MarketObservation,
                        has_acted: bool,
                        environment_reward: float):
        pass
```

### 2. Run the simulator
```bash
bazaar-simulate
```

### 3. Select your agent
In the UI, select `MyFirstAgent` from the dropdown and click the hammer button to build the game!

## Running Games Programmatically

You don't need the UI to run games:

```python
from bazaar_ai.bazaar import BasicBazaar
from bazaar_ai.trader import Trader

# Create two agents
agent1 = Trader(seed=0, name="Random Agent 1")
agent2 = Trader(seed=0, name="Random Agent 2")

# Create and run the game
game = BasicBazaar(seed=0, players=[agent1, agent2])
game.play()

# Game state is in game.state
print(f"Winner: {game.state.actor.name}")
```

## Next Steps

- **Read the documentation** in `docs/` (coming soon!)
- **Check out built-in agents** in `src/bazaar_ai/simulator/agents/`
- **Read the agents README** in `agents/README.md`
- **Experiment with strategies** - try greedy, lookahead, or learning-based approaches

## Common Issues

### "Command not found: bazaar-simulate"
Run `pip install -e .` again from the repo root.

### "No agents found"
Make sure your agent file is in the `agents/` folder and defines a class that extends `Trader`.

### WebSocket connection failed
Make sure port 8765 is available. Close any other instances of the simulator.

## Getting Help

- Check `agents/README.md` for agent development tips
- Look at example agents in `src/bazaar_ai/simulator/agents/`
- Open an issue on GitHub

Happy coding! 🎮
